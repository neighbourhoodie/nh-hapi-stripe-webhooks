# The Neighbourhoodie Hapi Stripe webhooks
A [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) plugin for receiving notifications from the [Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) API.

Stripe can send webhook events that notify your application any time an event happens on your account. The webhooks endpoint will need to authenticate webhooks as per stripe docs.
